# Building a Movie Recommender System Using Collaborative Filtering

This project implements a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering, a popular technique in recommendation systems. It includes Python code for implementing the collaborative filtering algorithm, training the model, making movie recommendations, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Usage

1. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (`W9_Collaborative_RecSys_Assignment.ipynb`) in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and follow along with the implementation steps.
3. The notebook includes sections for loading the dataset, implementing collaborative filtering, training the model, making movie recommendations, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used is derived from the MovieLens "ml-latest-small" dataset, focusing on movies released since 2000. It contains user ratings on a scale of 0.5 to 5 in 0.5 step increments.

## How to Run

Ensure that you have Python installed along with the required libraries such as NumPy, TensorFlow, and Pandas. Open the `W9_Collaborative_RecSys_Assignment.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to train the model, make recommendations, and evaluate its performance.
